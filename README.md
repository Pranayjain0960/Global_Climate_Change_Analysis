# 🌍 Global Climate Change Analysis
This project analyzes the relationship between global CO₂ emissions and temperature changes over time using data visualization and correlation analysis in Python.

## 📊 Project Objectives
- Investigate historical trends in greenhouse gas emissions.
- Visualize global temperature changes due to emissions.
- Identify correlation between CO₂ emissions and temperature rise.

## 🧰 Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas** for data manipulation
- **NumPy** for numerical operations
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for visualization

## 📁 Dataset
- Source: The analysis uses a dataset named global_temp.csv, which includes historical data on global CO₂ emissions and temperature changes attributed to greenhouse gases (GHGs).
- Key Columns: year,co2,temperature_change_from_ghg

## 📈 Key Visualizations
- **Line Plot**: Global temperature change from GHGs over the years.
- **Scatter Plot**: CO₂ emissions vs. temperature change.
- **Correlation Heatmap**: Strength of relationships between variables.

## 🔍 Sample Insights
- CO₂ emissions have steadily increased over decades.
- A positive correlation was found between CO₂ levels and global temperature rise.
- Visualization reveals strong GHG impact on long-term climate trends.
